Well down.
Some explanation:
Since I use a Chinese version of Amaze, it seems that I cannot use the function "d(description=" ").click() to automatically test the procedures I displayed in the vedio. Therefore, I use the weditor and adb tool to help me visualize the procedures using d(coodinate=(,)).click which can only reload in my phone as a plan B. If you have other points that can help me solve this problem, I'll appreciate looking forward to hearing that.
